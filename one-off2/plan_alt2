At least one couple must be defined in a tile

Now we can 

- again base on the prefer vector

     - defined inside tile or inside margin?
	 
- base on quality

- base on quality minus opportunity cost


Test cases: displacement phase 0

couple  c :  p[j]=  1, p[j+1] = -1 
        e :  p[j]= -1, p[j-1] =  1
		
single  s :  v[j] = 0


chains

upchain    u  not c and v[j] == 1 and p[j] == 1 
downchain  d  not e and v[j] == 1 and p[j] == -1 


Lemma:  right to an upchain can only be a couple 
        left  to an upchain can only be a single
		right to a downchain can only be a single
		left  to a downchain can only be a couple
		
Chain resolution

Margin single chain item  u . . . , . . . d : do nothing (lacking info)
Inner single chain item   . u . . , . d . . , . . u . , . . d . : convert to s
 u . . d  apply rule for margin single chain item, i.e. do nothing
 d . . u  apply rule for margin single chain item, i.e. do nothing

 
Two separate chain items, which are not both marginal

one margin, one inner 
 u . u .  cannot exist
 u . d .  cannot exist
 . d . d  cannot exist
 . u . d  cannot exist
 u . . u  cannot exist
 d . . d  cannot exist
 u . . d  apply rule for margin single chain item
 d . . u  apply rule for margin single chain item
 

Two neighboring chain items

 u u . .  convert to couple 
 u d . .  cannot exist
 . u u .  convert to couple
 . . u u  do nothing
 . . d d  convert to couple 
 . . u d  cannot exist
 . d d .  convert to couple
 d d . .  do nothing

Three chain items

 u u u .  convert the right items to couple 
 u u . u  cannot exist
 u u . d  cannot exist
 
 . d d d  convert the left items to couple 
 d . d d  cannot exist
 u . d d  cannot exist
 
 u . u u  cannot exist 
 d . u u  convert into d s c e , or into d c e s
 d d . d  cannot exist 
 d d . u  convert into c e s u , or into s c e u
 
 d d d .
 . u u u  convert into s c e u , or into c e c e
 
 u u u u  convert into u c e s , or into c e c e
 d d d d  convert into s c e d , or into c e c e 

 
Listing only the possible cases, and using symmetry  (u <--> d and reverse)
 
 u u . .  convert to couple 
 . . u u  do nothing
 . u u .  convert inner to couple 
 . u u u  convert into s c e u , or into c e c e
 u u u u  convert into u c e s , or into c e c e
 
 
 If majority is d, reverse and exchange d<->u , then reverse-exchange back.
 
 . . d d  convert to couple 
 . d d .  convert to couple
 d d . .  do nothing 
 . d d d  convert the left items to couple 
 d d . u  convert into c e s u , or into s c e u
 d d d .  convert into d c e s , or into c e c e
 d d d d  convert into s c e d , or into c e c e
